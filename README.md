## Description

This is my take on the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021), written in NodeJS.

## Usage

### Initialize a new day

```bash
yarn start init 01 # the day you want to initialize
```

The same instruction can be used to update the README as soon as part two is unlocked.

### Execute day

```bash
yarn start exec day01 # run part one and two of day01
yarn start exec -1 day01 # run part one of day01
yarn start exec -2 day01 # run part two of day01
```

### Tests

Run the tests:

```bash
yarn test
```
